Over the next few weeks I will be working to streamline this new blog section of my website. As my website has prevously existed I have had a landing page and several hidden, often inaccessable, sub-pages. I am looking to remedy this situation. This means that all the tutorials, newsletters, and projects will be migrating from their own separate island to one unified place hopefully mixed in with some of these new styled blog posts. I will also be completing the long overdue redesign of the main page so that it can support the unification of the entire collection of these previously separated entities.

## History

When I first started developing this site I had no clue what I was doing. I have since started many sub-projects all using the kevinuulong.com domain. Since when I designed the main page I had only had the creation of a basic contact and about me section planned, it is not well suited to all the sub-projects and other content that has sprung up since then.

In the near future I hope to completely revamp not only the main page, but also all the sub-pages for every sub-project that is on the domain.

## The Future

I am currently in the early stages of finishing the redesign. I have a few different design options and just have to find the one that fits a few key criteron:

1. Provides easy and intuitive access to all sub-pages.
2. Works well on all devices (This includes desktop vs. mobile, and technical differences in Chromium, Safari, etc.)
3. Loads well on all connections (even less than 5mbps)

This blog is currently built with a template; however, it is built using Gatsby so once I finalize my custom theme all the current content should transfer over just fine. This is bound to be a challenging process but it is something worth doing and a challenge I look forward to solving.
