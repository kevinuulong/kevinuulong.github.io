    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Over the next few weeks I will be working to
        streamline this new blog section of my website. As my website has prevously existed I have had a landing page
        and several hidden, often inaccessable, sub-pages. I am looking to remedy this situation. This means that all
        the tutorials, newsletters, and projects will be migrating from their own separate island to one unified place
        hopefully mixed in with some of these new styled blog posts. I will also be completing the long overdue redesign
        of the main page so that it can support the unification of the entire collection of these previously separated
        entities.</p>

    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">When I first started developing this site I had no
        clue what I was doing. I have since started many sub-projects all using the <a
            href="http://kevinuulong.com">kevinuulong.com</a> domain. Since when I designed the main page I had only had
        the creation of a basic contact and about me section planned, it is not well suited to all the sub-projects and
        other content that has sprung up since then.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">The current and original landing page. Note the
            absence of tabs of any sort.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">In the near future I hope to completely revamp not
        only the main page, but also all the sub-pages for every sub-project that is on the domain.</p>

    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">I am currently in the early stages of finishing the
        redesign. I have a few different design options and just have to find the one that fits a few key criteron:</p>
    <ol>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">Provides easy and intuitive access to all
            sub-pages.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">Works well on all devices (This includes
            desktop vs. mobile, and technical differences in Chromium, Safari, etc.)</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="24">Loads well on all connections (even less than
            5mbps)</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25"><img src="/images/newwebsite.jpg"

    <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">This blog is currently built with a template;
        however, it is built using Gatsby so once I finalize my custom theme all the current content should transfer
        over just fine. This is bound to be a challenging process but it is something worth doing and a challenge I look
        forward to solving.</p>
